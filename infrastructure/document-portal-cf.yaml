  RouteTable:
    Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref MyVPC

  RouteAssoc1:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
    Properties:
      SubnetId: !Ref Subnet1
      RouteTableId: !Ref RouteTable

  ### Security Group
  # ECS Security Group
  # This security group allows inbound traffic to the ECS tasks on port 8080
  # The security group is necessary to control access to the ECS tasks
  # It allows traffic from any IP address on port 8080, which is the port used by the Document Bot application
  # This is necessary for the ECS tasks to be accessible from the internet or other AWS services

  ### ECS Task Definition
  # ECS Task Definition
  # This task definition specifies how the Document Bot container should run in ECS
  # It includes the container image, CPU and memory requirements, port mappings, and logging configuration
  # The task definition is necessary for ECS to know how to run the Document Bot application
  # it defines the resources required for the task, such as CPU and memory, and how to log the output
